 <pre>
Yeah
North Side
Hallash, skillish, skallash
Ztekk
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-ya
Yow Kellz

Say you bad from which part?
Tell a pussy we nuh run lip, dawg
Like Chinese wall suh the clip tall
Shub it up a make you fall from you diss, dawg
You nuh want none a this 'cause man a big dawg
A so you disappear as if you never did born
Me know a couple killer, me nah just a sing song
With the people yuh mother tell you keep from
Ztekk full a bomb like Islam

And everywhere me carry it cah me know the enemy dem a pree
And me know dem nah sorry for me
People a bawl and a scream cah we bad and we mean
Bloody crime scene, calamity
A so we shoot out brain fi go Canada, G
Make your marrow experience nuh gravity

Tell a pussy we nuh laugh up
We nuh take talk
Violate, people a dead, dawg
You should a keep inna your bed 'cause the Talibans dem a make war
We nuh laugh up
We nuh take talk
Badness a weh we endorse
We nuh shoot people fi end up inna Red Cross

Yow, Talibans
Like dem need reassurance
Make unnuh sleep a yuh yard inna four months
A so we make people a moan out
Like gyal a get fuck down a whore house
Laff boss full a 'K, that me sure 'bout
And if you see me travel with a 9X
A nuh no politician weh me a go vote out
Four killer, four seat and four rounds
'Member me born Kingston
They love party, forget love drink rum
AK shake like a Jada Kingdom
Everything a get fuck like strip club
So me stay strap, we nuh play that
You will get it one time inna the same spot
Like iPhone, weh you air-drop
And me nuh go give a fuck
If a nuh bareback

And everywhere me carry it cah me know the enemy dem a pree
And me know dem nah sorry for me
People a bawl and a scream cah we bad and we mean
Bloody crime scene, calamity
A so we shoot out brain fi go Canada, G
Make your marrow experience nuh gravity

Tell a pussy we nuh laugh up
We nuh take talk
Violate, people a dead, dawg
You should a keep inna your bed 'cause the Talibans dem a make war
We nuh laugh up
We nuh take talk
Badness a weh we endorse
We nuh shoot people fi end up inna Red Cross

And tell a boy we nuh laugh up
We nuh take talk
Violate, people a dead dawg
Mhmm, mommy wan' know a weh your head gone
You should a keep inna your bed 'cause
And we a make war
Yow, dawg, man a make war, yow
Tell a boy we nuh laugh up
Anything a weh you get, dawg
